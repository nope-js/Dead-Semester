## Overview


**Dead Semester** is a slow-burn horror-thriller set in an Indian college where a routine blood drive becomes the ignition point for a viral outbreak — not designed to end the world, but to **engineer it**. But control is an illusion. The company behind it, SynGenix, watched its perfect system fracture from the inside. Now, trapped behind quarantine walls, a group of students must confront the infected, the lies they were raised on, and a chilling truth that was never meant to surface.
