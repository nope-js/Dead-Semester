## FULL EPISODE SCRIPT

---

### \[COLD OPEN – 00:00]

*INT. RESEARCH LAB – NIGHT*

Dim, humming fluorescent lights. A **rat** twitches in a cage.

A hand in black gloves injects a clear fluid into its neck.
Camera lingers on the cage…
**Heartbeat SFX rises**…
Suddenly, the rat **lunges**, hitting the bars with force.

A man’s voice (offscreen) murmurs:

> **"Subject 47. Neural disruption in 6 minutes."**

Camera pans to a sealed metal crate in the corner —
A label reads: **“A-17. Live Samples. Transfer: SynGenix Outreach.”**

**One corner of the crate dents outward—**
**SMASH CUT TO BLACK.**

> **TITLE: DEAD SEMESTER**

---

### \[ACT 1 – 00:45]

*INT. LECTURE HALL – MORNING*

Buzzing fan. Glowing sunlight. Students half-asleep.

**Aarav Sen** (21, final year, mechanical, quiet cynic) doodles on his hand with a black pen.

**Riya D’Souza** (21, design major, observant, sketchbook addict) scribbles portraits beside lecture notes. She’s drawing their professor.

**Prof. Menon (60s)** drones on:

> “Evolution doesn’t need to be perfect. Just… persistent.”

In the row behind:
**Zoya Feroze** (20, IT + menace, headphones half-on) is fighting her laptop.
She slams it shut, muttering:

> **Zoya:**
> “This thing needs a funeral.”

She grabs a pen, stabs a juice box straw like a ritual.

**Trisha Kapoor** (21, med student, sharp eyes, emotionally detached) shifts next to her, visibly annoyed.

---

*EXT. CAMPUS GROUNDS – LATER*

A banner waves in the breeze:

> *“BLOOD DRIVE – Give to Save. Booths open till 4 PM”*

Students walk past, laughing, busy.
Some join the line casually.

A clipboard rolls across the ground.
**Naveen Raj** (22, athlete brain + comp sci heart) picks it up and returns it.

> **Naveen:**
> “Organized chaos. That's how we survive fest season.”

---

### \[ACT 2 – 03:30]

 *INT. BLOOD DRIVE TENT*

Plastic curtains flutter. Hum of AC.

**SynGenix health workers** log donor data.
**One nurse** scans barcode after barcode on blood bags.

In a box nearby:

> **“A-17 / Priority Transfer / Handle with Caution”**

**Zoya** walks in with a friend, peeks at the table:

> **Zoya:**
> “Y’all giving cookies for blood? That’s how vampires win.”

> **Nurse (smiles):**
> “Chocolate or bourbon?”

> **Zoya:**
> “Ha, bribery it is.”

She donates. Winks at the guy flinching next to her.

---

*EXT. PARKING BAY – MINUTES LATER*

Two SynGenix workers haul sealed crates into a black van.
One glances at a clipboard:

> “Campus Code: PES-BLR-A17”

The van drives off slowly.

Behind it… a janitor coughs hard into a napkin.
He checks the blood on his palm. Quietly walks away.

---

### \[ACT 3 – 07:00]

*INT. CAMPUS CAFÉ – LATE AFTERNOON*

**Zoya**, **Riya**, **Trisha**, **Aarav**, and **Naveen** share a table.

> **Zoya (half-asleep):**
> “If I die before finals, please submit my internal marks manually.”

> **Trisha:**
> “If you die, I’m stealing your laptop.”

> **Riya:**
> “Guys…”

She points across the room.
**One student from the blood drive is being helped to his feet**, pale, dazed.

They all watch for a beat.

> **Zoya:**
> “He just donated blood, not fought a war. Man up.”

*They laugh. Move on.*

---

*INT. HOSTEL LOBBY – EVENING*

Soft yellow light. TV playing some news.

> *“...containment zones expanded near outskirts of Sector 17...”*

Nobody listens. Background noise.

---

### \[ACT 4 – 09:30]

*EXT. CAMPUS BACK GATE – DUSK*

Dogs bark wildly toward the forested side of campus.
One growls, backs off, tail between legs.

A silhouette stands beyond the gate, just out of reach of the light.

A breeze. The silhouette is gone.

---

*INT. SECURITY ROOM – NIGHT*

A guard yawns. Watches the monitors.

One camera feed flickers.
Another shows someone standing still in the middle of a hallway — not moving.
After 3 minutes, they **turn and walk away**.

> **Guard:**
> “…what the f—”

Signal cuts to static.

---

### \[ENDING – 11:00]

*INT. DORM BEDROOM – NIGHT*

The student who looked sick earlier is now lying in bed.
Face pale. Breathing uneven. Sweat on his pillow.

Silence.

Then, his **eyes snap open**, unfocused and bloodshot.
He lets out a **single breath**, slow and raspy.

Cut to black.

---

### \[POST-CREDIT SCENE – 12:30]

*INT. DARK ROOM – UNKNOWN LOCATION*

The **SynGenix van** arrives at a secure underground checkpoint.
Crates unloaded.

> Worker:
> “Batch A-17 delivered. No incidents.”

Inside the lab, a terminal lights up:

> **“Stage 1 samples collected. Begin analysis.”**

A crate in the back starts to **shudder** softly.

**CUT TO BLACK.**
