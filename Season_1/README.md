# DEAD SEMESTER – SEASON 1: *PATIENT ZERO*

*`Survival isn’t just about escaping the infected, but unlearning everything you were taught to trust.`*

---

## Overview

**Dead Semester: Season 1** kicks off with an eerily well-funded blood donation camp organized by biotech giant **SynGenix**. What starts as an ordinary college day — classes, gossip, lab pranks — descends into escalating paranoia, betrayal, and bloodshed. 

A sudden collapse of a student donor marks the beginning of an outbreak. Within hours, the infection spreads — but it’s not just a disease. It’s a controlled leak. And the campus is the cage.

A small group of students bands together, locking themselves in the **mess hall**, the only fortified building with working CCTV and metal-reinforced doors. As things spiral out of control, they uncover that they aren’t just survivors — they are **subjects**, monitored in real-time.

## EPISODE BREAKDOWN

### **Episode 1 – “Routine Check”**

- SynGenix organizes a campus-wide blood donation drive. Strangely, it’s far more funded and tech-heavy than usual. Military-grade equipment. Unmarked vans. Too much personnel for a college camp.
- Students go about their usual lives: banter, assignments, relationship drama, late-night snacks.
- **Aarav**, **Zoya**, **Riya**, **Trisha**, and **Naveen** — strangers to each other — are all present for the drive.
- One donor — a second-year named **Dev** — collapses hours later during a late-night walk.
- Medics arrive late. Dev doesn't regain consciousness… and his eyes don’t shut.

> *Foreshadowing*: A CCTV briefly shows Dev’s eyes twitching after he’s declared unconscious.

---

### **Episode 2 – “Control Subject”**

- Donors begin reporting headaches, nausea, and sensitivity to light.
- Power flickers during practicals. Some guards from the SynGenix unit are missing.
- Zoya notices crates being moved at night, escorted by men in black tactical gear.
- Trisha, a bio major, sneaks a glance at a patient slip — a barcode on the slip matches something she saw **years ago** during a mysterious clinic visit.
- Late at night, the mess kitchen’s cold storage malfunctions — and inside is a SynGenix body bag.

> *Foreshadowing*: Riya doodles an image of a crate being moved by masked men — hours before she saw anything.

---

### **Episode 3 – “Patient Zero”**

- During a cultural event, Dev — previously declared in coma — **walks into the open**, pale and twitching.
- He bites two students before he's restrained. One of them vanishes into the crowd.
- Panic erupts. College staff try to contain it — but no protocol exists for this.
- Within the hour, **five students** show fever and rapid aggression.
- The infection seems transmitted via **bite**, but incubation is **shockingly short** — under an hour.
- Aarav leads a spontaneous lockdown of the **mess hall**, bringing in Zoya, Trisha, Riya, Naveen, and six others.
- The mess hall has reinforced doors (installed after a protest in a previous year) and functioning CCTV, making it the best stronghold.

> *Detail*: One of the bitten students begins screaming in a locked dorm room. No one comes.

---

### **Episode 4 – “Curfew”**

- The campus splits. WhatsApp rumors fly. A self-proclaimed student “leader” tries enforcing lockdown zones with cricket bats and stolen keys.
- Some students use kitchen knives and fire extinguishers to fight back.
- Nights are worse — the infected **roam**, but seem drawn to sound and human scent.
- The mess group spots three infected trying to claw their way through a locked seminar hall door — slow, deliberate, **not mindless**.
- A fellow survivor, **Tanish**, argues with Aarav about letting in a screaming student outside the hall. Tanish opens the barricade — but the infected rush. They lose someone.
- Trust fractures.

> *Callback*: Zoya notices that the infected mimic past behavior patterns — one keeps going to the same vending machine spot every night.

---

### **Episode 5 – “In Memoriam”**

- They bury the dead behind the library garden — where no one goes.
- Riya keeps sketching her dreams — places she’s never seen, faces she doesn’t know.
- Zoya, armed with a soldering kit and old audio equipment, rigs a **sonic disruptor** using frequency modulation — the infected **react violently to high-pitched audio pulses**.
- Trisha identifies that the infection causes **localized neural inflammation** — turning pain sensors down and aggression up.
- Late at night, Aarav spots someone **watching them** from the old astronomy deck — not infected. Just... watching.

> *Foreshadowing*: Riya’s sketches start showing codes and data entries — matching the ones Zoya later finds in SynGenix logs.

---

### **Episode 6 – “Midnight Broadcast”**

- SynGenix hijacks the campus PA:  
  > “Remain calm. You are part of a resilience drill. Do not engage infected individuals. You are safe.”
- The students realize the **WiFi is dead**, but **one single router** — hidden in the admin block — is still active and broadcasting.
- Trisha decrypts network logs showing tags like `A17-LiveMonitor`, `HostEvents`, and `NeuroProfile:Active`.
- They realize the campus was **Test Group A-17** — a controlled population.
- Someone spikes the food with powdered sedatives — multiple students collapse. Panic again erupts.
- It wasn’t the infected. It was one of their own.

> *Easter Egg*: A paused frame on the admin monitor shows Riya’s childhood image in a file marked **“Group B – Dormant Cognitive Layer.”**

---

### **Episode 7 – “Evacuate”**

- SynGenix helicopters arrive — dropping leaflets with QR-coded evacuation passes.
- Only **priority-tagged** individuals (based on SynGenix internal profiling) are permitted extraction.
- Aarav, torn between escape and staying, makes the hardest call. **He chooses Zoya to stay** — she's not on the extraction list, and she insists she won’t go.
- Three are taken. The rest stay back, hearing gunfire from the biotech lab in the distance.
- As the helicopter leaves, Riya finds one of her drawings — taped to the windshield of an abandoned SynGenix truck. She never drew it.
- On the cafeteria wall, written in dried blood:  
  > **"Don’t let them win."**

---

## Thematic Threads

- **Surveillance disguised as care**: SynGenix appears helpful but has been tracking neurological profiles.
- **Foreshadowed Fate**: Riya’s sketches hint at psychic memory leakage or subconscious data injection.
- **Isolation Psychology**: The claustrophobia of the lockdown tests empathy, guilt, and survival instinct.
- **Sound & Memory**: Zoya’s sonic disruptor + infected following sound lays groundwork for the memory theory in S2.
- **The Lie of Authority**: SynGenix's calm broadcasts only deepen the horror, showing how deeply they're orchestrating events.

## Hidden Seeds for Future Seasons

- The crate seen in Ep2 is marked with “B-CLASS: dormant.”
- Trisha’s barcode familiarity connects to **her SynGenix clinic visit at age 10** — revealed in S2.
- Riya’s sketches already show **The Tower** — the neural AI server site central to S3.
- Zoya’s sonic tech evolves into the **“Digital Disruptor”** in S2/Ep2.
- A coded tag seen briefly in logs: `CURE_CODE: null` — future title.

## Closing Note for Season 1

Season 1 ends not with closure — but **containment**. We don’t leave the campus yet. The world beyond is hinted at but not revealed. The infection is not a plague — it's a **design failure**.

The mess hall may be safe for now. But the virus isn’t the only thing mutating.

> *"College ends. But this semester never will."*
